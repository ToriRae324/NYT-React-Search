# NYT-React-Search

### Overview

This app is a simple React-based rendition of the New York Times Article Search application. This app was built using multiple created from scratch React components, helper/util functions, and utilizes the React mounting lifecycle to query and display articles based on user searches. This app also uses Node, Express and MongoDB so that users can save articles to read later.
